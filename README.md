# Salman Quazi
Hi! I am the Director of Engineering for CoreAI at Microsoft in Silicon Valley, CA. We live in the Bay Area, and have mostly been a California native (except for a short 2 year stint in Seattle). I am a total geek about software design and really the only thing I am good at. I love everything about the software design process, from the problems, to the way systems are designed, down to the beauty of design patterns. It's truly an exciting time to be a software engineer. 

## How I work
My focus is innovation and bringing new ideas into products. I have more than 17 years of software development experience building successful cloud native services, while managing large, diverse multi-site teams.
